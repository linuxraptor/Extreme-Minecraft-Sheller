HIGHLIGHTS:

* No permanent changes to the system. Can switch between this script and any other minecraft startup method.
* Large performance enhancements.
* Automatic backups.


DEPENDENCIES:

* 4GB of RAM
* Linux kernel 2.6.x or newer.
* Java runtime environment of any kind (Sun JRE, Icedtea) later than 1.6


WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

"Just start it."

The need for simplicity drove me to write this script; I wanted a script that I could run and not worry about editing all kinds of variables or remembering long java commands for optimization.

No bullshit. Just a working script that manages, well, everything. ... Automatically.


WHAT DOES IT DO?

It copies the contents of your minecraft world into RAM and runs the minecarft server from there.

This offers a pretty extreme performance increse. Instead of spending expensive hard drive seeking and reading time trying to report to your users, the world stored in RAM reports to minecraft via a symlink. 

The RAM syncronizes deltas to the hard drive folder only when users have visited, saving precious read-write cycles on solid-state devices while also allowing several safety mechanisms for power failure or system crashes.

When the script is halted softly by entering "stop" into minecraft, it leaves the minecraft world files on the hard drive such that minecraft can be started vallila-style (java -jar minecarft_server.jar).

Upon system failure, the script can recover the minecraft server and world. Using several automatic backup systems, no information is ever lost beyond 4 minutes and 56 seconds.


TODO:

* Automatic console redirection for lost shells (i.e., logout).
* Automatic recovery in event of system failure.
* Automatic retrieval of minecraft_server.jar.
