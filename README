This script is being entirely rewritten.  Current code experimental only and its use is NOT recommended.

Details on this script's infancy:
* The current RAM sync is the first thing being rewritten.
  It is dangerous.  It sometimes erases all the minecraft data in the folder.
* The original script moved the world to a new location, but this was not
  really a "backup" considering it was the only location that world existed.
* When the world really balloons in size (like if someone walks in one direction
  for several days), a single large .tar.gz backup can wipe out all of the other
  backups in your folder with no sanity check whatsoever.
* Really, don't use this script.



HIGHLIGHTS:

* No permanent changes to the system. Can switch between this script and any other minecraft startup method.
* Large performance enhancements.
* Automatic backups.


DEPENDENCIES:

* Linux kernel 2.6.x or newer with dev/shm support (for world file caching to RAM).
* Oracle Java runtime environment 1.8 or newer (for G1 garbage collection).


WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

"Just start it."

The need for simplicity drove me to write this script; I wanted a script that I could run and not worry about editing all kinds of variables or remembering long java commands for optimization.

No bullshit. Just a working script that manages everything automatically.


WHAT DOES IT DO?

It can copy the contents of your minecraft world into RAM and runs the minecarft server from there.

This offers a pretty extreme performance increse. Instead of spending expensive hard drive seeking and reading time trying to report to your users, the world stored in RAM reports to minecraft using a crafty mountpoint. 

This script rsyncs deltas to the hard drive folder only when users have visited, saving precious read-write cycles on solid-state devices.

When the script is halted softly by entering "stop" into minecraft, it leaves the minecraft world files on the hard drive such that minecraft can be started vallila-style (java -jar minecarft_server.jar).

Upon system failure, the script can recover the minecraft server and world. Using automatic backups, no information should be lost beyond 4 minutes and 56 seconds.


TODO:

* Automatic console redirection for lost shells (i.e., logout).
* Automatic recovery in event of system failure.
* Automatic retrieval of minecraft_server.jar.
* Literally tons of other stuff that I have ranted about in the scripts stored here.
